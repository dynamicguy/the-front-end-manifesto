### Groundwork Tasks

With any new Rails application their are some very basic groundwork tasks that should be completed.

#### Task 1: Version Control

In the Rails world Git and Github are the versioning sytem and service of choice. Here are the steps to follow when creating a new Rails application:

    Switch to new project folder.
    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -am "Initial commit."
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<Github username>/<application name>.git
    Create a new repo at Github.
    $ git push -u origin master

#### Task 2: Remove Unnecessary Files

Out-of-the-box Rails comes with a few files that should be deleted. After testing that your application works, delete:

- public/index.html
- assets/images/rails.png
- assets/stylesheets/application.css
- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
- README.rdoc

The last three deletions will be replaced in the next task by files from our [starter code][]: *application.scss*, *application.html.haml* and *README.md*.

Commit your changes.

#### Task 3: Add Starter Code

Go ahead and copy all the files and folders from your cloned starter code repository into your existing application structure.

Commit your changes.

The following files should have been added to your repository:

![][New Files]

#### Task 4: Gemfile

With every new application Rails generates a Gemfile with a lot of commented out lines. You don't need all of these comments, they take up a lot of space and clutter things up. For our [Gemfile][] we will start with Michael Hartl's "[Ruby on Rails Tutorial][RoR Tutorial]" example and add a few additional gems we will use like Compass:

      # Compass specific gems.
      gem 'compass-rails'
      gem 'oily_png'
      gem 'susy'

Or some better error testing gems:

      # http://railscasts.com/episodes/402-better-errors-railspanel
      # gem 'better_errors'
      # gem 'binding_of_caller'
      # gem 'meta_request'

After replacing the default Gemfile with the one found in the cloned starter code, bundle install these gems.

IMPORTANT: Michael Hartl [recommends][] using the following flag on your first bundle:

    $ bundle install --without production

Doing so installs your Gemfile gems, but prevents the installation of the production gems. You only have to do this once.

Commit your changes.


#### Task 5: RSpec

To set up rspec run the following:

    $ rails generate rspec:install

Commit your changes.

#### Task 6: Deployment

Heroku is a cloud application platform used by many members of the Rails community. Deploy to Heroku by running the following commands:

    $ heroku create --stack cedar
    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku rename <new name>

You will need to set up an account if you don't already have one.
