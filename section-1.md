Section I - Setting up the Foundation
-------------------------------------

Section I is comprised of four chapters written to help developers set up and understand the components of a Ruby on Rails front end code base:

[Chapter 1][] lays out the groundwork for an applications *Foundation Markup*, i.e. view templates.

[Chapter 2][] explains how our foundation markup is organized and best practices moving forward.

[Chapter 3][] adds *Foundation Styles*, CSS, to the foundation markup laid out in Chapter 1.

[Chapter 5][] explains how our foundation styles are organized and best practices moving forward.

Our goals in these chapters are to:

1.  Demonstrate how to start a Rails applications out right – soup to nuts – from the front end view coders perspective.

2.  Provide example code and the files needed for a solid front end code foundation.
