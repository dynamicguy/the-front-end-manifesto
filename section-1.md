Section I - Setting up the Foundation
-------------------------------------

Section I is comprised of three chapters written to help developers set up and understand the components of a Ruby on Rails front end code base:

[Chapter 1][] lays out the groundwork for an applications *Foundation Markup**, i.e. view templates.

[Chapter 2][] adds *Foundation Styles*, CSS, to the foundation markup laid out in Chapter 1.

[Chapter 3][] explores *Mobile on Rails* and the options available for a complete front end foundation.

Our goals in these three chapters are to:

1.  Demonstrate how to start a Rails applications out right – soup to nuts – from the front end view coders perspective.

2.  Provide example code and the files needed for a solid front end code foundation.
