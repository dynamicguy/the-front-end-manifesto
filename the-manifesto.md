The Manifesto
-------------

**When I code I will:**

1.  Seek perfection and excellence, write beautiful code.

2.  Future proof code.

3.  Provide intelligent and semantically correct hooks and code snippets for backend teams.

4.  Abstract logic out of views, keep view code out of controllers.

5.  Provide for the mobile experience as a forethought.

6.  Employ progressive enhancements and graceful degradation.

7.  Be consistent, keep code well organized, readable and DRY.

8.  Test across major browsers, devices, and in front of "real-life" users.

9.  Think in terms of all use cases including and especially accessibility.

10. Architect and design for the end user, not developers.

11. KISS (keep it simple stupid)

12. Sufficiently comment or document code.
